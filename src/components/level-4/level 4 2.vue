      I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree.
    </p>

    <p class="border">
      A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing
      breast; A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to
      pray.
    </p>

    <p class="border">
      A tree that may in summer wear A nest of robins in her hair; Upon whose
      bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain.
    </p>

    <p class="border">
      Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.

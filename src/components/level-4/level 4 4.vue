<p class="font">I think that I shall never see

A poem lovely as a tree.

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest

Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;

A tree that looks at God all day,

And lifts her leafy arms to pray.

A tree that may in summer wear

A nest of robins in her hair;

Upon whose bosom snow has lain;

Who intimately lives with rain.

Poems are made by fools like me,

But only God can make a tree.</p>

    Joyce Kilmer – Trees I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree.
    A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
    A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray. A tree
    that may in summer wear A nest of robins in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow
    has lain; Who intimately lives with rain. Poems are made by fools like me,
    But only God can make a tree.

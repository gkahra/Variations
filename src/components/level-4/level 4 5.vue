      Joyce Kilmer – Trees I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a
      tree. A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth’s sweet flowing
      breast; A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to
      pray. A tree that may in summer wear A nest of robins in her hair; Upon
      whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain. Poems are made
      by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.

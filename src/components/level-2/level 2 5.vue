    <p>I think that I shall never see</p>

    <p>A poem lovely as a tree.</p>

    <br />A tree whose hungry mouth is prest

    <h4>
      Against the earth’s sweet flowing
      <h1>breast;</h1>
    </h4>

    <ol>
      A tree that looks at God all day,
    </ol>

    And lifts her leafy arms to pray.<br />

    <ol>
      A tree that may in summer wear
    </ol>

    A nest of robins in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately
    lives with rain. Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a
    tree.

    <h5>I think that I shall never see</h5>

    <h1><big>A poem lovely as a &nbsp;t&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;e&nbsp;.</big></h1>

    A tree whose hungry mouth is prest

    <p>Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;</p>

    A tree that looks at God all day, And
    <ul>
      lifts
    </ul>
    her
    <ul>
      leafy
    </ul>
    arms to
    <ul>
      pray.
    </ul>

    <p>A tree that may in summer wear</p>

    <p>A nest of robins in her hair;</p>

    <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;</p>

    <ul>
      Who
    </ul>
    intimately
    <ul>
      lives
    </ul>
    with
    <ul>
      <br />r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />a<br /><br />i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />n.<br />
    </ul>

    <p><br />Poems are made by fools like me,<br /></p>

    <p>But only God can make a tree.</p>

    <h1>Joyce Kilmer – Trees</h1>

    I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a
    <p><small>t&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;e&nbsp;.</small></p>

    A
    <p><big>t&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;e&nbsp;</big></p>
    whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast; A
    <p><small>t&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;e&nbsp;</small></p>
    that looks at <big>God</big> all day, And lifts her leafy arms to
    <strong>pray.</strong>

    <p>A</p>
    <p><big>t&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;e&nbsp;</big></p>
    that may in summer wear A nest of
    <ol>
      robins
    </ol>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in her hair;

    <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;</p>

    Who intimately lives with rain. Poems are made by fools like me, But only
    God can make a
    <p><small>t&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;e&nbsp;.</small></p>

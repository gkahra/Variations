    Joyce Kilmer – Trees

    <p>I think that I shall never see</p>

    A poem lovely as a tree.

    <p>A tree whose hungry</p>
    <li>mouth</li>
    <p>is prest</p>

    Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;

    <p>A tree that looks at</p>
    <li>God</li>
    <p>all day,</p>

    <p>And lifts her</p>
    <li>leafy</li>
    <p>arms to pray.</p>

    A tree that may in summer wear

    <p>A nest of</p>
    <li>robins</li>
    <p>in her hair;</p>

    Upon whose bosom snow has lain;

    <P>Who intimately</P>
    <li>lives</li>
    <p>with rain.</p>

    Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.
